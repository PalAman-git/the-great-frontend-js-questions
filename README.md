# The Great Frontend – Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to various challenges from [The Great Frontend](https://thegreatfrontend.com/).  
Each challenge focuses on **core frontend skills** including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice real-world frontend problems.
- Document my learning process.
- Showcase high-quality, production-ready code.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each challenge is organized into its own folder:

```
the-great-frontend/
 ┣ counter/             # Counter component challenge
 ┣ accordion/           # Accordion UI challenge
 ┣ tabs/                # Tabs component challenge
 ┣ js-logic-questions/  # JavaScript coding problems
 ┃ ┣ 01-two-sum.js
 ┃ ┣ 02-palindrome.js
 ┃ ┗ ...
 ┗ README.md
```

Inside each folder you’ll typically find:
- `index.html` → Base markup
- `style.css` → Styling
- `script.js` or `App.jsx` → Functionality/logic
- `README.md` → Challenge-specific notes (description, demo link, learnings)

## 🧩 JavaScript Logic Questions

This repo also includes a collection of JavaScript problem-solving exercises.  
These are implemented in the `js-logic-question/` folder.

| Two Sum | [01-two-sum.js](./js-logic-question/01-two-sum.js) | Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target. |
| Palindrome Checker | [02-palindrome.js](./js-logic-question/02-palindrome.js) | Check if a given string is a palindrome. |
| FizzBuzz | [03-fizzbuzz.js](./js-logic-question/03-fizzbuzz.js) | Classic FizzBuzz logic implementation. |
| ... | Coming soon | More questions will be added regularly. |

### Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills in JavaScript.
- Practice writing clean, efficient algorithms.
- Prepare for frontend interviews with logic-based questions.

```

Open `index.html` directly in your browser,  
or if it’s React-based:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
